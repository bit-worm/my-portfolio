# ⚒️ Building

- This app is writen with pure HTML CSS and JavaScript.

- This web app shows the use of CSS styling to beautify a site and JavaScript to give it functionality.

- The app is hosted on *netlify* a free hosting site with *forms* support.

- This project took 3 days, it had me up late at night trying to figure out CSS 😄

- I hope all who visit will enjoy. ✌️

- The app will get more updates with time as I grow my knowledge.
